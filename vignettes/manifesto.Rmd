## Preamble

This manifesto started out as an issue on the Github repository - this seems like a better place for it. It started out as an aspirational document, so that I could look at the package API all in ine place. It is slowly being implemented.

## Manifesto

The purposes of the bsplus package:
1. Provide access to [Bootstrap's Javascript components](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/), created by setting attributes of HTML tags.
2. Provide functions for some compound components.

The fact that there is more than one item on this list suggests that this should be more than one package, I hope that I will be forgiven for keeping them together at this nascent stage.

It may be useful to prepend all the functions with `bs_`, to keep the namespace clean.

### Grammar

- `bs_noun()` We are creating a thing. 
- `bs_noun_verb(thing, ...)` We are taking an action on the `thing`.
- `bs_noun1_verb_noun2(thing1, thing2)` We are taking an action on `thing1` using `thing2`. 

If we have an S3 class, then:
- `bs_verb(thing, ...)` We are taking an action on the `thing`.
- `bs_verb_noun(thing1, thing2)` We are taking an action on `thing1` using `thing2`. 

#### Verbs

- `bs_append(tag, ...)` we are appending something to the tag, perhaps a panel into a panel-group, or a set of attributes.
- `bs_attach(tag, ...)` we are attaching something to the tag
- `bs_emded(tag, ...)` we are embed something as part of the tag
- `bs_set_opts(tag, ...)` we are setting some options for the tags yet to be appended

Let's consider the differences between`append`, `attach`, and `embed`.
- We can **append** more than one element to a tag, i.e., we would append multiple panel elements to an accordion.
- We can **attach** only one thing to a tag. When we are attaching, we attach the id of an element, not the element itself.
- We can **embed** only one thing into a tag. i.e., into a given tag, we embed a tooltip or a popover, modifying the attributes and setting a child element.

### Note

Going back-and-forth a lot in my head as to the extent to which these functions should use the S3 framework.

#### Helper function

``` R
bs_set_data(tag, ...)
bs_set_aria(tag, ...)
```

for the each of the named `...` args
- prefixes the names with `data-` or `aria-`
- converts logical values to `"true"` and `"false"`
- converts lubridate durations to milliseconds
- converts vectors to space-delimited character strings

**Note** we have to go around the htmltools API to set (rather than append) the attributes - this will need to be addressed.

## Components

For the first pass of this package, it is proposed to provide access to some useful components not already offered in Shiny:
- [collapse](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse)
- [accordion](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse-example-accordion)
- [modal](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals)
- [tooltip](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips)
- [popover](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers)
- [carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel)

We also propose a compound component:
- accordion_sidebar

### Collapse

``` R
bs_collapse(id, content)
bs_attach_collapse(tag, id_collapse)
```

#### Example

``` R
tags$button("Click me") %>%
  bs_attach_collapse(id_collapse = "ex_collapse")

bs_collapse(id = "ex_collapse", content = tags$p("Hi there")) 
```

### Accordion

S3 class

``` R
bs_accordion(id)
bs_append(tag_accordion, title, content)
bs_set_opts(tag_accordion, panel_type, use_heading_link) # boostrap type: "default", "primary", etc.
```

#### Example

``` R
bs_accordion(id = "meet_the_beatles") %>%
  bs_append(title = "John", content = tags$p("Rhythm guitar, vocals")) %>%
  bs_append(title = "Paul", content = tags$p("Bass guitar, vocals")) %>%
  bs_append(title = "George", content = tags$p("Lead guitar, vocals")) %>%
  bs_append(title = "Ringo", content = tags$p("Drums, vocals"))
```

``` R
bs_accordion(id = "with_the_beatles") %>%
  bs_set_opts(panel_type = "primary") %>% 
  bs_append(title = "John", content = tags$p("Rhythm guitar, vocals")) %>%
  bs_append(title = "Paul", content = tags$p("Bass guitar, vocals")) %>%
  bs_append(title = "George", content = tags$p("Lead guitar, vocals")) %>%
  bs_set_opts(panel_type = "info") %>%
  bs_append(title = "Ringo", content = tags$p("Drums, vocals"))
```

### Modal

``` R
bs_modal(id, title, content, footer, size)
bs_attach_modal(tag, id_modal)
```

#### Helpers

Need to think this through

``` R
bs_modal_closebutton(title = "Close")
bs_embed_modalhelp(tag_shinyinput, id_modal)
# bs_modal_helplink(id_modal)
# bs_embed_helplink(tag_shinyinput, tag_link)
```

#### Example

``` R
bs_modal(
  id = "help"
  title = "I need somebody"
  content = tagList(
    tags$h4("Help!"),
    tags$p("Not just anybody")
  ),
  footer = bs_modal_closebutton(title = "Close")
)

tags$button("Help!") %>%
  bs_attach_modal(id_modal = "help")

selectInput(
  inputId = "beatles_for_sale",
  label = "Choose a Beatle",
  choices = c("John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo")
) %>%
  bs_embed_modalhelp(id_modal = "help")
```

### Tooltip

``` R
bs_embed_tooltip(tag, title)
```

#### Example

``` R
tags$button("John Lennon") %>%
  bs_embed_tooltip(title = "Rhythm Guitar, vocals")
```

### Popover

``` R
bs_embed_popover(tag, title, content)
```

#### Example

``` R
tags$button("John Lennon") %>%
  bs_embed_popover(
    title = "More information",
    content = "Although he wrote \"I Am the Walrus\", he later insisted that the Walrus was Paul."
  )
```

### Carousel

S3 Class

``` R
bs_carousel(id, use_indicators, use_controls)
bs_append(carousel, content, caption)
bs_append_img(carousel, src, alt, caption)
bs_carousel_caption(title, content) #helper
```

#### Example

``` R
bs_carousel("the_beatles") %>%
  bs_append_img(
    src = "img/john.jpg", alt = "John Lennon", 
    caption = carousel_caption("John Lennon", "Rhythm guitar, vocals")
  ) %>%
  bs_append_img(
    src = "img/paul.jpg", alt = "Paul McCartney", 
    caption = carousel_caption("Paul McCartney", "Bass guitar, vocals")
  ) %>%
  bs_append_img(
    src = "img/george.jpg", alt = "George Harrison", 
    caption = carousel_caption("George Harrison", "Lead guitar, vocals")
  ) %>%
  bs_append_img(
    src = "img/ringo.jpg", alt = "Ringo Starr", 
    caption = carousel_caption("Ringo Starr", "Drums, vocals")
  ) 
```

### Accordion Sidebar

This is an add-on that makes it easier to fit more stuff into a shiny app. S3 class

``` R
bs_accordion_sidebar(id, spec_side = c(width = 4, offset =0), spec_main = c(width = 8, offset = 0), position = "left") 
bs_append(accordion_sidebar, title_side, content_side, content_main)
bs_set_opts(accordion_sidebar, panel_type_active, panel_type_inactive, use_main_panel) 
```
