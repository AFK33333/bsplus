Description: The Bootstrap framework lets you add some Javascript functionality to your web site by
  adding attributes to your html tags - Bootstrap takes care of the Javascript
  (https://getbootstrap.com/javascript). If you are using R Markdown or Shiny, you can
  use these functions to create collapsible sections, accordion panels, modals, tooltips,
  popovers, and an accordion sidebar framework (not described at bootstrap site).
